<div class="row">
    <p>At the moment, I am not available Full-Time. But I am available for part-time/freelancing/contract/consulting works form 20 to 30 hours/week @ 30USD/hr, non-negotiable. </p>
    <p>I have been lucky and grateful to have worked with small teams (usually 1- 4 person) in my past. It had enabled me to assume various roles within each project which includes Architect, Tech Lead, Back-end Engineer, Front-end Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Scaling Engineer, iOS Engineer, Consulting, Trainer, client-handling and so on. Since I have worked in such versatile roles simultaneously, I have learned how to reduce friction within team and work efficiently.</p>

    <p>And if you look at my profiles, you can see that I am a “Wannabe Startup Polymath”. And that is what I am striving to be. A one-stop shop for startups. </p>

    <p>But I got to say, I lack Designing Skills. But I fill that gap with Bootstrap or Foundation or something similar. Will be working on it in the near future.</p>
