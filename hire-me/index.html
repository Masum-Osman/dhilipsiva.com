<div class="row">
    I have been lucky and grateful to have worked with small teams (usually 1- 3 person) in my past. It had enabled me to assume various roles which includes Architect, Tech Lead, Back-end Engineer, Front-end Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Scaling Engineer, iOS Engineer, Consulting, Trainer, client-handling and so on. <br/><br/>

    And this is not on a per-project basis. I have assumed all (or most) of these roles in each of the products that I have ever worked in. Since I have worked in such versatile roles simultaneously, I have learned how to reduce friction within team and work efficiently. <br/><br/>

    And if you look at my profiles, you can see that I am a “Wannabe Startup Polymath”. And that is what I am striving to be. A one-stop shop for startups. <br/><br/>

    But I got to say, I lack Designing Skills. But I fill that gap with Bootstrap or Foundation or something similar. Will be working on it in the near future.<br/><br/>
