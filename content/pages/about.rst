About Me

VPE @Reckonsys. Hitoshīkage @Nitimis. An Optimistic Nihilist who loves World Peace, Science, Python, Rust, FOSS, e-Games, Fitness, Astrophysics & தமிழ்.

I usually spend most of my time building python (micro)services. But I also have built production services with JavaScript (Frontend + Node), C, Go, PHP, Ruby, Objective-C, C# & Java. I have worked on all levels of a typical web application stack. I design (architecture), implement, deploy, scale and maintain backend code, frontend code & infrastructure:

* GraphQL, RPC & RESTful microservices with Python
* JavaScript frontends with Ember & React
* Rust frontend with WebAssembly
* Scaled a couple of high-traffic web applications
* Deploy services on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud (Fabric, docker, AWS copilot, Kubernetes, etc.)
* Built small tech teams over and over again (5-15 engineers)
* Can design and develop resource-efficient, reliable, maintainable, secure & scalable products
* Setup DevOps pipeline
* iOS apps with Objective-C
* Have built Android and iOS device farm
* Have built RaspberryPi bitcoin mining farm with custom ASIC chips
* Have developed a bunch of open-source tools that are useful for web development.
* Have contributed to a bunch of open-source projects
* Have built hobby IoT & robotic projects (very simple stuff)
* Have Reverse Engineered and "hacked" a bunch of mobile applications for fun

Lately, I have developed a keen interest in Rust programming language, WebAssembly & Distributed software.

I also care a lot about progressive politics. I try to volunteer for progressive candidates around the world in whatever nano capacity I can.
