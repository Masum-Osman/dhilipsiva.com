Greetings, Earthling!

This is my first post on [dhilipsiva.com](http://dhilipsiva.com). Have been thinking to switch from `Heroku + Flask` to `GitHub + Jekyll` for about a year now. But I never really got any time. This month, I quit my job at [LaunchYard](http://launchyard.com), so that I can launch my very own startup, thank you very much! Finally, I made the switch today.

It is been really great working at LauchYard. I learnt so many things from [Atif](https://in.linkedin.com/in/atifh) (CEO, LaunchYard). If you are reading this Atif, thank you!

I have decided to dive into `Big Data` and `Machine Learning`. Its been a passion for me to do BD and ML for almost a year now. I am very excited to do something on my own.

Anyways, I wrote this post just to say "Hi". So, I'll sign-off for now. Will catch you soon.
