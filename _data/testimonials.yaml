I know him since my second year of Engineering which was his first year, and right at that time he had started building simple game softwares. That was pretty impressive of him. During the next 3 years in our college, I had observed him taking part in student initiatives with a few other students in promoting open source software usage/development and helping his student friends in learning various programming languages. Later he went on to work for various startups and had done some amazing code contributions.
In short he is a self taught code-geek. And am happy that am connected to him. Here is wishing him the best on his future endevours."
