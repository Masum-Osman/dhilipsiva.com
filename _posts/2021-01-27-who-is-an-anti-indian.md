title: 'Who is an Anti-Indian?'
---

### A handful of people had called me an `Anti-Indian` in the past.

The very first time I heard someone call me that, I paused for a moment and I gave it a deep thought. `Am I really an Anti-Indian?` I asked myself. At times, a person's view points are biased towards their own self-interest. So they tend to look at things subjectively, rather than being objective. I did not want to fall into this trap. I honestly wanted to change myself if I am objectively an `Anti-Indian`. India is my mother country and she has provided me with a wonderful life. So being an Anti-Indian is a betrayal of love & opportunities that mother India has offered me. So if there is even a slightest chance that I am an Anti-Indian, I wanted to change myself.

### But, how can I look at this objectively?

First we need to establish who an `Indian` is. So who is an Indian? It's not really a complex question. The answer is straightforward. If you are born in India, then you are an Indian. As simple as that. It is not an opinion, it's an indisputable fact. One can't claim someone else is not an Indian because of their stereotypical subjective views. Even if you were not born here, If you manage to get an Indian Citizenship, you are still an Indian.

Next we should decrypt what `Anti-Indian` means. Does it mean you don't like the soil in India? Nope. Does it mean you don't like buildings in India? Nope. Does it mean you don't like the animals or climate or the companies here? Nope, Nope, Nope. It means you don't like the people of India. Well, you don't have to hate each and every Indian to be Anti-Indian, as long as you hate a significant chunk of them, you could be classified as `Anti-Indian`.

And then I asked myself, do I hate a significant chunk of Indians? Hell, no! Not even close! I hate maybe like 100 Indians. That is an insignificant fraction of **1.3 BILLION**. So obviously, I am not an Anti-Indian.

### So who is an Anti-Indian?

Do you remember the [Indian pledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pledge_%28India%29) that we took as kids in schools? It goes something like this:

```
India is my country
All Indians are my brothers and sisters.
I love my country,
and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage.
```

they keyword here is: **ALL INDIANS ARE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS**.

As I write this post, one of the major problems that we face as a divided nation is that of Hindu vs. Muslim. India is a Secular country and there are dozens of religions and 100s of gods here. For the moment, let's set aside all the other religions. Not because they don't matter, just because there are no significant conflicts within others.

For the record, I am an Atheist and a man of science. I happen to believe that religious people, in general, are under a mass delusion. I have no quarrel with religious people as long as they don't force their ideologies on me or on people of other faith. As long as one respects these boundaries, I respect them regardless of their religious affiliation. So religion X and religion Y are all the same to me.

If you are Hindu and hate muslims just because they are muslims, you are an Anti-Indian. Because you hate about 200+ Million Indians who are muslims. If you are a muslim and hate Hindus just because they are Hindus, then you too are an Anti-Indian. But both are not the same. Roughly 80% of India is Hindu. So Hindus who hate muslims would be able to do much more damage than muslims who hate Hindus. With roughly 80% of India being Hindu, most of the government is naturally run by Hindus (Obviously, a statistical probability). This could be devastating for muslims, if they decide to make policy changes against muslim. Muslim, being a minority, will most likey never control enough government to bring a policy change that could affect hindus devastatingly. We are the largest democracy after all. When a country's most vulnerable (minority) is absolutely protected, then you know for a fact that you are also absolutely protected. But the reverse is not true.

So any right winger who has called me an Anti-Indian is ironically an actual Anti Indian. If you have supported BJP's agenda, you should know that you supported an Anti-Indian's agenda. FYI I hate Congress too. Both parties are shitty parties, but at least Congress is not trying to pit Hindus against muslims.

F#ck all politicians.
