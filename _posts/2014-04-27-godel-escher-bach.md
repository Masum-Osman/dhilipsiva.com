### An Eternal Golden Braid

[Godel Escher Bach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) is my most favorite book. And I recommend this to all the aspiring programmers out there.

Through this book, Douglas Hofstadter, explains how `self` is evolved. This book contains a lot of `recursive` and `self-referential` patters. This book will throw your mind into a state of profound thinking. At some point, I thought my brain (or what is left of it) was going to melt as I read it. I am enjoying this book so much. I haven't completed the book, yet. I will give an update when I am done. But until then, here is an interesting thing happened because I happened to meet a friend who read this book. I ll try explaining as much short as possible.

I was speaking with one of my friend the other day, and he happens to state his hypothesis that time and space might *not* be continuous. This is just a fun conversation, which I found very interesting. For his justification, he used [Zeno's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes) as tool to validate it. Space has a smallest unit below which it cannot be further divided. By this way, Achilles can take huge number of finite steps to win the tortoise in the race. Thereby proposing that space may be discreet.

I was thinking about that. And I think it is not possible for space to be discrete. Here is my justification. Lest assume smallest unit of matter to be `mloop` (Smaller than quarks). Consider point `A` and point `B`. Lets assume that smallest unit of space is `sloop`. Now `A` is away from `B` by one `sloop`. `mloop` cannot be smaller than `sloop` as `sloop` is smallest unit of space. Now, `mloop` needs to moved from `A` to `B`. But there is no transition from `A` to `B` as nothing can exists between them. So logically speaking, `mloop` has to disappear from `A` and reappear in `B`. And think that this is ridiculous. Because this means the matter has to disappear from space in order to move to the nearest point in space. So I don't think that space might be discreet.

Of course, I was thought from a very small age that Space-Time is a continuum, but I was just analysing the information to myself rather than blindly believing it without any questions. This is just one small stuff that GEB helped me think. This is my I recommend this stuff to all the programmers out there. It helps you think greatly.

I would love to hear your opinion in the comments below.
