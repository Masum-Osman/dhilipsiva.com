title:     It isn't programming, its freedom!
---

If you have read my post "[It isn't programming, it's parenting!](/2014/05/09/its-not-programming-its-parenting.html)", you would have know by now that, I see myself as a parent and not just a programmer. In this post I am trying to explain why programming means `freedom` to me.

I am not sure how many people are mature enough to understand this post. By mature, I mean intellectual maturity. So, I ll try hard explaining so that almost any one can understand this post.

#### Freedom to Choose

Perhaps one of the biggest lies taught by the society is the `freedom to choose`. That is one big-fat-ass lie. But it is one of the most believable lies ever told. It took me almost 20 years to see through the lie. Truth is, most of human-kind do not have the `freedom to choose`. It, merely, is an `Illusion of choice`.

Don't know what I am talking about? Let me make it easier for you yo understand. Consider a huge zoo. It has so many animals
