Hello Everybody!

Welcome to Bangalore Machine Learning Meetup (BangML)!!

If you have known me for some time, you know that I am quite enthusiastic about ML. I was trying to join some local groups but the content did not satisfy me. So I thought that I will create my own group and promote it.

Are you a Machine Learning expert? Or someone who is enthusiastic about Machine Learning? Then this group is for you. Lets get together & share what we learnt. TensorFlow. SciKit. PredictionIO. NuPIC (numenta). Bots. Neural Networks. Deep Neural Networks. Deep Learning. Computer Vision. NLP. Kaggle. Data Analysis / Visualization. Python. Julia. Octave. Matlab. Aerosolve. GoLearn.

Here is how to join:
