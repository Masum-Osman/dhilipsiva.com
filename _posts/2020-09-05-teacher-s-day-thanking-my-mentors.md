title: 'Teacher's Day - Thanking my mentors'
---

Not a single person on this planet is ever self-made. A `self-made [any title]` is a total BS. If Nikola Tesla did not do what he did, we would't know Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zukerberg and the list goes on. If Newton did not do what he did, we would never heard about Einstien. These are just some obvious examples.

We stand on the shoulders of the giants who has built this civilization. A few millenia ago, no one knew how to write. Trun back time even a while back, no one even knew how to make proper sentences. But some group of people, by a mere chance, got together and did all these things (over a very long period of time, of course). They formalized the way of speaking. They disovered its not scalable and some other group of people came up with crazy idea of writing (etching on stone, on palm leave, etc) it down somewhere. All these things have lead to the raise of people that are famous today.

The famous people that we know today would be nobody, if they were born else where or had a different upbringing. And it goes without saying one should also make effort to become a successful individual. I am not implying that these fomous people have never worked hard, they must have. But hard work alone is not enough, there is also a factor of luck and sometimes it is a huge factor.

Nikola Tesla did amazing things. For all the contributions he did to humanity, he was unable to pay even his hotel bills in the last stages of his life (but somehow found funds to feed his pegions :P). There are countless people who has worked (and still work) many times harder than the famous people that we know today. But for many, the reward that they get for all thier hard work is unfairly low.

With all that being said, a mentor is one of those things that make make or break a person. I am lucky to have had such amazing mentors in my life. I thought I will take time to thank them on this Teacher's day.

## Sivaiah Thonaiah & Sundary Sivaiah (Granpa and Grandma)

My grandparents are my first mentors. I was not raised by my mom or dad like most people. I was raised by my grandparents. They taught me many things. They taught me how to lead a honest life. They said hard work is an important asset to a human being. They taught me its important to be compassionate than to be smart. They paved they way for everything that is to follow. More importantly, they put a roof over our heads, foods on the table and cloths to wear. They dedicated their entire being to raise us. And now they are doing the same for my kids and my brother's kids. Without them, me and my bother would probably be begging on street. To that, I thank them: Thank you Ayya and Amma, I literally owe you my life.

## Rajendran Sivaiah (Uncle)

I wanted to become a sofware engineer because of my uncle. He was always cool and he broght home many gadgets. He has always been too kind to me when I was a kid. He taught me how to use computers (+ programmabe calculators, camcorders, cameras). He paid my tuition fees many times. He encorouged me (and paid for) my computer courses. He purchased my first ever laptop. He purchased me countless books. My first ever computer was his old pentium 2 computer. My first ever bicycle was his old Hero cycle. My first ever bike was the Yamaha RX 100 bike that he used. My first ever job, I got it because my uncle recommended me to his friend who was running a startup (Mahesh CR, Tataatsu). I tried emulating my uncle in many ways. But I also failed to lived upto his expectaions in some personal areas. To that, I want to tell him: Thank you & Sorry Mamu.

## Jaya Sivaiah and Chandrasekeran (Mom and dad)

I am not a very smart person. Honestly, my intelligence is just marginally above average. But whatever intelligence I have, I owe it to my mom. She used to buy logical reasoning books when I was a kid and used to teach me. I asked too many 'why?'s as a kid. She almost always answered it patiently (even if was sometimes BS). She always encoraged my curisity. My dad was never around, but he taught me just one thing and he taught it very well: brotherhood. Thank you Jai & Appa.

## Boomiraj Sokkaiyan (School Teacher - Science)

There are plenty of reasons I love Science so much. One of them is Boomiraj Sir. It was my 8th grade, and I still remember the day he taught me about Atoms. He explanied it so well, that I still remember what he wore that day (But then again, he has a pretty standard dress code). You kindled my love for science. Thank you sir.

## Elizabeth, Loreta, Nirmala (School Teachers)

Elizabeth mam and my family have a special relationship. She has taught many people from my family. She taught me multiple subjects. I am not fluent in spoken english (but then again I am not fluent in any spoken language - I almost always struggle to get a point across, regardless the language, when speaking) - but whatever little english I know I owe it to Loreta mam. She was too kind too. Nirmala mam taught me how to use Office Suites (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc). To all of them I say, thank you mam :)

## Sam Sir (School Teacher - Math)

No offence to my other Math teachers, but Sam sir is one of the coolest Math teachers I had. He taught me math concepts so well that I still remember some of the formulas that he taught :) Thank you sir.

## Balaji Jagadeesan (School Teacher - Physics)

Although Balaji Sir was a Physics teacher, he taught me an important life lesson. He was one of the teachers who belived that I am capabale of bigger things in life. He is one of the smartest people that I have ever met personally. There are times in every person's life when they would lose thier way. I have also lost my ways multiple times in my life. When I asked him to fill out a scrapbook, he refused. But that week, he wrote a 2-page long letter trying to point out the error of my ways and directed me towards the right path. After 15 years, I still have that letter, laminated. One of the most important pieces document in my life. A letter that turned me away from a self-destructive path. He recited a quote from cricket, `Form is temproary, but class is permanent` and explained my broken form that I come to be and pointed me to the class that I belonged to. To this day, whenever I feel low in life, I read his letter and it gives me strength to believe in myself. Sir, you have done more than just to teach me physics. I will keep you letter safe until I draw my very last breath. Thank you Sir :)

## Mahesh CR (Mentor - CEO, Tataatsu)

These days, the number of people who like me seeme to be higher than the number of people who dislike me. But that was not always the case. Most people who like me today would have hated me, had they met be before or during my days at Tataatsu. I used to think that the world revolved around me. I used to be a spoiled brat. But Mahesh CR, took me in because my uncle recommened me. Its becasue of him I started coding in Python (the language that I would fall in love with). More importantly, its because of him, I was able to recognize that I had a lot of arrogance. I was kicked out of Tataatsu by Mahesh sir. If it was anyone else, they would have kicked me out in just 1 or 2 months. But Mahesh sir put a lot of effort to groom me for a year. He kicked me out in the hopes that I will learn my lesson, and it did teach me an important lesson. But me and Mahesh sir have a very good relationship even after that happened. Sir, you put me on the right path and taught me what humility means, thank you sir. I will never foget your teachings for the rest of my life :)

## Subho & Harshit (Mentors - CTO & CEO, Appknox)

There are some things that are personal and can't be shared publically. This is one such thing. But in summary, they taught me a trick to look at things from a different perspective. They taught me a fun new way of thinking which helped play devil's advocate whenever I am debating myself thinking of a problem. There are countless sessions at our Appknox office when we used to sit together and just talk and laugh liie mad people. Thank you guys for introducing me to this new way of thinking (it helped me in more ways than you can imagine).

## And many more

It takes a village to raise a child. Anyone who thinks that some people are self-made are just delutional, IMHO. Every single one of them had help from other (directly or indirectly) to get to where they are (or were). I don't think I have mentioned everyone who has helped me get this far either. I am pretty sure that I missed someone. The people mentioned above are just the ones who are on top of head.

Thank you mentors for dragging me this far in life.
